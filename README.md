# VERIFICATION OF KIRCHHOFF’S LAWS
## 📘 *1. Verification of Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL)*  

### *Aim*  
To verify Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law by measuring the voltages across each resistor in a closed loop and proving that the algebraic sum of voltages is zero.

---

### *Objectives*
- To apply KVL in a closed electrical loop.  
- To measure voltage across each resistor.  
- To compare theoretical and practical values.  
- To understand the real-time application of Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law.

---

### *Procedure*
1. Make circuit connections by dragging nodes in the simulation.
2. Connect power supply (1–9, 2–10).
3. Connect voltmeters across the resistors.  
4. Click *CHECK* to validate connections.
5. Set R1, R2, R3 values.
6. Turn *Power ON*.
7. Adjust voltage slider and observe voltmeter readings.
8. Click *ADD* to store readings.
9. Take *minimum 6 readings*.
10. Click *PLOT* to generate the graph.
11. Use *PRINT* if needed.
12. Click *RESET* to restart the simulation.
